## üí° **Key Takeaways**

- **Monoliths** are simple to start, but can become complex as projects grow.
- **Microservices** offer flexibility, scalability, and independent deployments, but introduce more complexity and cost.
- The choice depends on project size, team structure, and future scalability needs.
