# Episode 3: **Creating our Express Server** 🚀

> "Every great backend starts with a simple server."  
> — Inspired by Namaste Node.js S2

---

## 🛠️ **Project Initialization**

- Learned how to create a Node.js project from scratch.
- Ran `npm init` to generate a `package.json` file — the metadata blueprint for my project.

---

## 📁 **Project Structure**

- Created an `src` folder to organize code.
- Added `app.js` as the main entry point.

---

## 📦 **Installing Express**

- Installed Express using `npm install express`.
- This step:
  - Added `node_modules` (where dependencies live).
  - Updated `package.json` with Express as a dependency.
  - Generated `package-lock.json` to lock exact versions.

---

## 🔢 **Versioning**

- Every new project starts at version `1.0.0`.
- `package.json` shows declared versions, while `package-lock.json` reveals the actual installed versions.

---

## 🌐 **Creating the Server**

- Built a basic Express server.
- Added request handlers to manage incoming requests.

---

## 📝 **Homework & Key Concepts**

1. 🗂️ Create a repository
2. 🏁 Initialize the repository
3. 📦 Understand `node_modules`, `package.json`, and `package-lock.json` (and their differences)
4. 🚀 Install Express
5. 🖥️ Create a server
6. 🎧 Listen on port `7777`
7. 🔄 Write request handlers for `/test` and `/hello` routes
8. 🔥 Install Nodemon and update scripts in `package.json`
9. 🌍 Learn the use of the `-g` flag for global package installs
10. 🧐 Understand the difference between caret (`^`) and tilde (`~`) in `package.json`

## 💡 **Key Takeaways**

- Express makes server creation easy and modular.
- Understanding project structure and package management is crucial for scalable apps.
- Nodemon boosts productivity by auto-restarting the server on changes.
- Versioning symbols (`^`, `~`) help manage dependency updates smartly.
